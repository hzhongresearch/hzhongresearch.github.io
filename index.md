Another HEaring AiD scenes Data Set (AHEAD-DS) is a publicly available audio dataset of audiologically relevant environments for hearing aids. OpenYAMNet/YAMNet+ is a lightweight audio recognition model for deployment on resource constrained edge devices, it is a fully open source re-implementation of YAMNet.

The goal of this project was to design a workflow and toolchain to deploy audio recognition models to smartphones connected to wireless earphones. This project offers a baseline audio recognition model and a standardised dataset for comparing audio recognition models. This is a first step to creating AI enhanced hearing aids.

### VeinDeep

[Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316733062_VeinDeep_Smartphone_unlock_using_vein_patterns)  
[Code](https://github.com/hzhongresearch/veindeep_program)  
[Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hzhongresearch/veindeep_data)

VeinDeep is a system which uses an infrared (IR) depth sensor to extract vein patterns from a person's hand. The idea is in the future smartphones will be equipped with Kinect V2 like IR depth sensors. Such sensors can be used to identify the smartphone owner using vein patterns and provide a way to unlock the phone. This project was created during my PhD. The associated research paper was presented at PerCom 2017.

### QuickFind

[Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301583832_QuickFind_Fast_and_contact-free_object_detection_using_a_depth_sensor)  
[Code](https://github.com/hzhongresearch/quickfind_program)  
[Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hzhongresearch/quickfind_mask_data)

QuickFind is a fast segmentation and object detection algorithm using only depth maps. Depth maps are images captured from depth sensors like Kinect. The idea is in the future depth sensors will be common so such an algorithm will be useful. This project was created during my PhD. The associated research paper was presented at PerCom Workshops 2016.

The data contains amended ground truth of the RGB-D Scenes dataset used in the QuickFind paper. The ground truth in the original RGB-D scenes dataset had many errors so I manually traced out the location of each object. Credit for RGB-D Scenes goes to Lai et al. Please visit their [site](https://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/dataset.html) and credit them if you use my amended data in conjunction with their RGB-D Scenes dataset.
